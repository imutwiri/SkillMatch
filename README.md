# SkillMatch

SkillMatch is a modern web platform that enables users to barter services and skills with others in their local community. No cash required—just fair trades! Users can create profiles, list skills they offer or need, find matches, chat, and build their reputation through reviews.

## Features

- 🌟 **Skill/Service Exchange Marketplace**: Trade your skills for services you need.
- 👤 **User Profiles & Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and personalized profiles.
- 💬 **Messaging**: Chat with other users to negotiate and arrange trades.
- ⭐ **Reviews & Ratings**: Build your reputation through community feedback.
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience on any device.

## How It Works

1. **Create Your Profile**: List the skills you can offer and what you need in return.
2. **Find Matches**: The platform connects you with people who have what you need and need what you have.
3. **Trade & Review**: Connect, negotiate the exchange, and leave reviews to build your reputation.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Backend**: (API endpoints expected at `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register`)
